# British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience Programme on Forage

I completed a British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience Programme provided on Forage on August 2023. Through this programme, I got an insight into how British Airways utilises data science tools to understand their customer's travel experience and get an understanding of the buying behaviour among the customers. There are couple of tasks which were worked on during this programme. Different data science techniques like sentiment analysis, NLP, Machine Learning, Data Mining and Visualization.

1. Web scraping to gain company insights and Sentiment Analysis of customer reviews
   Customer reviews of British Airways are extracted from Skytrax using BeautifulSoup and then sentiment analysis and wordcloud generation is carried to understand the customer's travel experience with the airline.

2. Predicting customer buying behaviour
   Customer buying behaviour is understood after interpreting and analysing the data and identifying useful insights. Data is prepared for after applying classification models to predict the booking completion status. In addition, Cross-Validation technique is also used to improve the accuracy for the models.
